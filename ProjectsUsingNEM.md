It supports open standards such as Z-Wave, ZigBee, and general RF, as well as IP-based APIs for existing smart home devices. 
Note that even though Ethyl is primarily based on the blockchain, most communication happens off chain to eliminate fees during day to day use. In short: Ethyl safely and securely moves the internet of things onto the NEM Blockchain.

- LocationCore
  - Website: https://www.digital2go.com/blockchain/
  - Telegram: https://t.me/locationcore
  - Description: We aim to be a transparent and honest data collection company using the NEM blockchain as a way to mitigate the trust relationships consumers often have with app providers. We would set up a namespace and mosaic on the NEM blockchain that would act as the base currency for the remuneration of user data, they would be awarded these mosaics as a reward for the time they have shared their location data with us. All transactions will be recorded in this base currency with users having the option to “cash out” to fiat or hold their tokens with the hope of it appreciating in price. As the uptake of the application continues the transaction volume will also increase. By forging partnerships with app developers and IoT product developers we aim to create an entire ecosystem whereby location data is rewarded at point of creation on the NEM blockchain increasing both the visibility and value of XEM as a currency and everyone’s ROI in the process. We chose NEM because it doesn’t require complicated cryptographic knowledge or dangerous smart contract development in a long-term unproven language, we can use the languages and tools we are most efficient with in order to deliver what we feel is a solid project (Proposal: https://forum.nem.io/t/locationcore-democratising-personal-user-location-data-through-the-nem-blockchain/12577).
