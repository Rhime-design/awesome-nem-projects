## Authenticity
* [Apostille (integrated in NanoWallet)](https://blog.nem.io/apostille/) - Join [Telegram](https://t.me/nemred) - With the release of NanoWallet, NEM is introducing its first version of Apostille, a second-generation blockchain notarization service. The word “Apostille” was popularized during the Hague Convention of 1961 in an agreement signed by 112 countries to make Apostilles the official form of international notarizations. The NEM blockchain and Apostille program takes the same idea of notarizations but instead of having notaries backed by political will and treaties, has notarizations backed by an international and decentralized blockchain bound by computer code and cryptography.
* [LuxTag](http://luxtag.io) - We are providing the first ever digitized certificates of authenticity for products (or machines, or vehicles, etc.) on a blockchain that will be updatable, can have messages attached, and their conjoint ownership can be flexibly transferred.
* [OpenApostille](https://www.openapostille.net/) - OpenApostille is a service with which you can share your Apostille created by NEM Wallet (NanoWallet) with everyone. Your ideas, thoughs, illustrations, whatever you put into Apostile as a promise will be public and garner attentions by using OpenApostille. Let's make a certificate by NEM Apostile and share it by OpenApostille.
* [PROVER](https://prover.io/) - Join [Telegram](https://t.me/prover_nem) - PROVER is a blockchain service for confirming the authenticity of the events, facts, or phenomena. This is achieved through the confirming the authenticity of the video on which this event was recorded. If the video is real - the fact is true. If the video being faked - no. It can be taken into account to make legal and financial decisions based on it ([Proposal](https://forum.nem.io/t/prover-a-block-hain-service-for-confirming-the-authenticity-of-events-facts-or-phenomena/13210)).

Their app utilizes the NEM protocol to allow patients to share selective medical records with their medical care providers in time locked sessions on an as-needed basis. This gives patients full rights to their data and makes them more active participants in their treatment process.
* [RMIT University](https://youtu.be/iUElP1E40Ns?t=126) - Please watch YouTube video
* [Snap Interactive](http://www.snap-interactive.com/) - SNAP was attracted to NEM as a “best-of-class” scalable blockchain technology offering secure Proof-of-Importance consensus protocol, configurable assets, and smart signing contracts. NEM’s node reputation system and native multisig capabilities provide the high level security standards required to meet SNAP’s design philosophy for Backchannel. We believe that NEM’s technology is highly regarded in the blockchain industry, and significant developer adoption has fueled the XEM coin to obtain a market capitalization ranking in the top 10 of all crypto-currencies.
* [XPOS Consortium](https://xpos.co/) - XPOS Consortium will transform the traditional economy with a solution that unites loyalty points, alternative payment gateways, payment devices as means, crypto payment service providers, crypto remittance agents, licensed money services companies into one.

The platform could deploy on NEM as its independent ledger book of record and a key component to the Approved by Abacas Proof of Asset product. Abacas distinguishes itself by promoting ancillary chain offerings in the areas of asset provenance, AML/KYC and identity/document authentication ([Proposal](https://forum.nem.io/t/the-abacasxchange-a-nem-blockchain-powered-universal-asset-exchange/10113)).
* [ATUM](https://atumchain.com/) - Join [Telegram](https://t.me/atumpreico) - Atumchain is a decentralized cryptocurrency trading platform. The goal of Atum is to provide transparent client-client (wallet-wallet) trades without depositing funds in the exchange and to provide clearing of these settlements. Clients of Atumchain will execute trades directly with each other. The main aim is to build a bridge between blockchains where orders are kept and to realize them when the required conditions are met (bridge-momentum). Bridge-momentum is the moment when transaction is considered to have been executed and it is the time to make payment. The transaction is considered to have been executed at the moment when the first pair which meets the price terms is found and transaction volumes are balanced. Clients may cancel or change the transaction before bridge-momentum but when it occurs this chain is frozen until the moment of the settlement and volume rebalancing takes place.

## ICO
* [COMSA](http://www.comsa.io) - Join [Telegram](https://t.me/comsaio) - COMSA is not just a cross-chain controller and router. It is also a conduit for future ICOs that want to exist in the COMSA ecosystem.

## IoT
* [Ethyl](https://forum.nem.io/t/ethyl-the-future-of-the-internet-of-things/12106) - Join [Telegram](https://t.me/ethylC) - Ethyl decentralizes the internet of things using the NEM blockchain. Every building or household installs a single hub that also acts as a decentralized server. As long as electricity is flowing in the home or building, the IoT devices will keep working without relying on internet access or centralized servers. (Except, of course, when chain functionality is required to communicate with or read data from other devices.) Ethyl supports offerings from a wide variety of vendors. It supports open standards such as Z-Wave, ZigBee, and general RF, as well as IP-based APIs for existing smart home devices. Note that even though Ethyl is primarily based on the blockchain, most communication happens off chain to eliminate fees during day to day use. In short: Ethyl safely and securely moves the internet of things onto the NEM Blockchain.

## Loyalty/Rewarding
* [FamilyPoints](https://familypoints.io/) - Join [Telegram](https://t.me/familypointstoken) - Our mission is to disrupt the parenting industry in order to make it safer, more convenient, and more transparent for everyone involved. The FamilyPoints platform will make parenting cheaper and education more accessible. We are creating the world’s first fully transparent blockchain ledger which stores information about reviews, rewards, and transactions to build a system of trust for children’s products and education.
* [Fluffr](https://fluffr.io) - Fluffr is working to create the use of Augmented Reality to engage with customers. Think about it for a moment. You go to an event, you pull out your phone, you interact with the environment, and you receive Fluff Tokens or Carat Tokens. That's right... Fluffr allows people to earn crypto currency by being part of the event in the virtual world. Unlike traditional crypto mining rigs like ASICs for BTCs or GPU/CPUs for Ethereum that allow you gain new crypto coins, Fluffr allows you to mine or "earn" tokens by using Fluffr's own "Proof of Engagement". And this POE is built on top of the NEM Blockchain foundation. This unique form of user engagement can be fun for consumers and beneficial for businesses.
* [LocationCore](https://www.digital2go.com/blockchain/) - Join [Telegram](https://t.me/locationcore) - We aim to be a transparent and honest data collection company using the NEM blockchain as a way to mitigate the trust relationships consumers often have with app providers. We would set up a namespace and mosaic on the NEM blockchain that would act as the base currency for the remuneration of user data, they would be awarded these mosaics as a reward for the time they have shared their location data with us. All transactions will be recorded in this base currency with users having the option to “cash out” to fiat or hold their tokens with the hope of it appreciating in price. As the uptake of the application continues the transaction volume will also increase. By forging partnerships with app developers and IoT product developers we aim to create an entire ecosystem whereby location data is rewarded at point of creation on the NEM blockchain increasing both the visibility and value of XEM as a currency and everyone’s ROI in the process. We chose NEM because it doesn’t require complicated cryptographic knowledge or dangerous smart contract development in a long-term unproven language, we can use the languages and tools we are most efficient with in order to deliver what we feel is a solid project ([Proposal](https://forum.nem.io/t/locationcore-democratising-personal-user-location-data-through-the-nem-blockchain/12577)).
